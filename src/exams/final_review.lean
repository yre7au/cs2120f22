I asked ChatGPT whether 0 = 1 implies 2 = 3. Here's 
the answer I got. So just how smart is ChatGPT?

"No, 0 does not equal 1 and therefore the statement 
"0 = 1 implies that 2 = 3" is not true. In mathematics, 
the equal sign (=) is used to indicate that two 
expressions are equal in value. So, if 0 did equal 1, 
then it would be true that 2 equals 3 because any 
number multiplied by 0 is equal to 0. But since 0 
does not equal 1, the statement is not true."
